Grashoff’s Law:
For a planar four bar linkage, the sum of the shortest and longest links cannot be greater<br>
than the sum of the remaining links if there is to be continuous relative rotation between two<br>
member<br>




Inversions<br>

<img  height="169" src="../images/pos4.png"  width="261"><br>
A mechanism has been defined above as a kinematic<br>
chain in which one of the links is fixed. From<br>
the four bar mechanism, different versions of each of them can be obtained by fixing<br>
any one of the links p, q l or s<br>
. Such different versions, which can be obtained by fixing any of the different<br>
links, are called its “Inversions”. Many a time, a particular inversion of a mechanism may give<br>
rise to different mechanisms of practical utility, when the proportions of the link lengths are<br>
changed.<br>
By this principle of inversion of a fourbar chain, several useful<br>
mechanisms can be obtained.<br>
There are three inversions of four bar mechanisms, which are obtained by fixing different links of<br>
the kinematic chain. They are:

a)Double Crank Mechanism<br>
b)Crank Rocker Mechanism<br>
c)Double Rocker Mechanism<br>



Double Crank Mechanism<br>


<img  height="169" src="../images/pos5.png"  width="261"><br>
A double crank converts rotary motion from a crank to a second crank or link in a different<br>
plane or axis. It is also known as crank- crank, drag<br>
-
crank or rotary<br>
-
rotary converter. The links p,<br>
q and l shown above rotate through one complete revolution. This is one of the<br>
first inversions of four<br>
-bar mechanisms.
In this discussion, let’s call the link‘s’ the frame as the fixed link. We will call the link ‘q’ the crank,<br>
‘p’ the coupler and ‘l’ the lever for now. Crank is not defined as the link, which is attached to the<br>
driver shaft; rather it’s the link, which does a complete revolution. And in this configuration, as<br>
there are two links, both q and l, which revolves completely about the hinged point on the frame,<br>
both of them, is cranks.The term is commonly used in automotive technology for the link in a four bar steering linkage<br>
that converts rotation of a steering arm to a center link and eventually to tie-rod links which<br>
pivot the wheels to be steered. A double crank is used when the steering arm operates in a plane<br>
above the other links. The double crank converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear<br>
motion in the plane of the other steering links<br>



Crank-Rocker Mechanism<br>


<img  height="169" src="../images/pos6.png"  width="261"><br>

In a four bar linkage, if the shorter side link revolves and the other rocks (i.e., oscillates), it iscalled a crank-rocker mechanism.<br>
In this case, there is only a slight change, leavethe smallest side and connect any of its adjacent<br>
side as the frame. Then (in figure) the smallest side ‘s’ will have full 360 degree revolution while<br>
the other link adjacent to the frame has only oscillating motion (link p). This kind of mechanism<br>
is hence called a crank-lever mechanism or a crank-rocker mechanism or a rotary-oscillatingconverter<br>

Double-Rocker Mechanism<br>


<img  height="169" src="../images/pos7.png"  width="261"><br>
A linkage in which no link undergoes entire 360-degree revolution but only oscillations is known<br>
as adouble-levermechanism.This linkage results when the shortest side in the mechanism is made the coupler. The other t<br>
wo links only get to oscillate in their place. A linkage in which the sum of the longest and shortest<br>
link is less than the sum of the other two sides, is known as a Class I mechanism, otherwise it’s<br>
Class II. This mechanism is achieved when it is Class II. It’s also called rocker-rocker mechanism,double-rocker mechanism or oscillating oscillating-converter<br>

Parallel Crank Mechanism<br>


<img  height="169" src="../images/pos8.png"  width="261"><br>
If in a 4 bar linkage, two opposite links are parallel and equal in length, then any of the links can<br>
be made fixed, regardless, the two adjacent links will always act as a pair of cranks, i.e. , both w
ill have complete revolution about their joints on the frame.<br>
The use of such mechanism is made in coupled wheels of locomotives in which the rotary motion<br>
of one wheel is transmitted to the other wheel.<br>
